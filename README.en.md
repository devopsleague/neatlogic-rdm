cases, test plans, and more. It integrates
with [neatlogic-deploy](../../../neatlogic-deploy/blob/develop3.0.0/README.md) and neatlogic-codehub (available in the
commercial version only) to offer full lifecycle management from requirements to code to version releases.

and defects as common applications. The commercial version further supports test plans, test cases, GitLab, Gantt
charts, dashboards, and storyboards.
